HELP LIST QUIT

2. EDIT functionality:
EDIT will always start from the 1st field.
Type NEXT PREV to sift thru the fields. 

3. The "Cmd availability panel".
Assign a bit-mask for commands. Pass the appropriate bit-mask to the current menu.

4. system("") commands:
Wrap it in another function to easily change for different OS.
